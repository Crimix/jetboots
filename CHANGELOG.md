# Jet Boots Changelog
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),


## [1.16.3, 1.1.0] - ????-??-??
- Completly changed the upgrade system.  
Warning this will remove upgrades already applied to boots!
- Added more Guardian armor.
- Changed to use a level system.  
This means that no longer is the helmet really good to protect you, 
and the boots can not be upgraded directly to increase armor. Instead you earn it back by leveling up the armor.
- Added a Guardian sword.
- Changed recipes.
- Removed current compatibilities as the upgrades added can no longer be used.
- Added compatibility for refined storage for helmet to access wireless crafting.
- Helmet is not longer soulbound from the start, level up to get it back.
- Helmet is now craftable and can not be found in The Nether or The End.

## [1.16.3, 1.0.0] - 2020-11-21
- Port to 1.16.3+

## [1.15.2, 1.0.0] - 2020-10-25
