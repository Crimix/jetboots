# Jet Boots Changelog
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),

## [1.18.1, 1.2.1] - 2021-12-xx
- Port to 1.18.1
- Refined Storage mod compatibly has been re-added, it might break as RS is only in beta.

## [1.17.1, 1.2.1] - 2021-12-12
- Changed recipe for the Jet Boots to require a Netherite Ingot
- Changed recipe for the Rocket Boots to require Diamonds instead of Emeralds
- Fixed the Guardian armor not having any damage protection, toughness or knockback resistance
- Fixed missing JEI integration for upgrades

## [1.17.1, 1.2.0] - 2021-12-11
- Port to 1.17.1
- Disabled Refined Storage mod compatibly for now as RS has not been ported for 1.17+ yet.
- Added much more config options for controlling the leveling of items and how OP they will become.
  Part of this fixes [#24](https://github.com/Crimix/jetboots/issues/24).
- Added Rocket Boots, that work like a limited jetpack, there is no hover and you can only fly for a limited time and which will replenish over time when not in use.  
  These are now considered tier 1 of flight in this mod.   
  They will level up and get more flight time and as the rest of the items this is configurable.  
  This part fixes the rest of [#24](https://github.com/Crimix/jetboots/issues/24).
- Changed the recipe for the Jet Boots to required Rocket Boots. 

## [1.16.3, 1.1.0] - 2021-01-17
- Completly changed the upgrade system.  
**WARNING this will remove upgrades already applied to boots!**
- Added more Guardian armor.
- Changed to use a level system.  
This means that no longer is the helmet really good to protect you from the start, 
and the boots can not be upgraded directly to increase armor. Instead you earn it back by leveling up the armor.
- Added three enchantment book slots to all equipment.
- Added a Guardian sword.
- Changed recipes.
- Removed current compatibilities as the upgrades added can no longer be used.
- Added compatibility for refined storage for helmet to access wireless crafting.
- Helmet is not longer soulbound from the start, level up to get it back.
- Helmet is now craftable and can not be found in The Nether or The End.
- Soulbound is no longer a upgrade, you need to level up for items to be soulbound.
