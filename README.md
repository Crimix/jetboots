# Jet Boots
[Jet Boots](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jet-boots) is a rethinking of the classical flying, normally it is jetpacks or rings, but this time it is **boots**.
The boots have two flight modes and two speeds.

Fligt Modes:  
- Creative flying
- Elytra

These speed modes only apply to elytra flying mode.  
Speed Modes:
- Normal
- Super (Really fast)

The jet boots are upgraded using modules, there are many different kinds and also support for more to come as compatibility between mods.
Right now there are extra modules from the following mods:
- Cyclic
- Mekanism

This mod requires [BML](https://github.com/Crimix/bml).
